;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library dired-lis (dired letter isearch) let you isearch in
;; `dired-mode'.  You only need press letter like in TC(Total commander), not
;; need press some keys to active isearch(in dired-isearch, or in dired-aux in
;; emacs23, you need call M-x dired-isearch-forward or M-x
;; dired-isearch-filenames to active isearch, but in dired-lis minor mode, when
;; you type 0..9, or a..z , or A..Z(which you can customize), the isearch mode
;; active automatically, and the letter is insert into isearch input area
;; automatically.  If you do not need letter isearch in `dired-mode', you can
;; execute C-u M-x dired-lis-isearch-forward-always?, then isearch-mode active
;; always even if you press enter in sub directory until you press C-g or other
;; keys to abort isearch.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Copy dired-lis.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'dired-lis)
;;
;; Then toggle letter isearch with M-x dired-lcs-mode.  To enable letter isearch
;; in all dired-mode buffers, use M-x global-dired-lcs-mode.
