  ;; enter the default elisp debugger: debug, when error happends.
  (setq debug-on-error t)

  ;; pause a few seconds at each break point
  ;; when in edebug `trace' or `continue' mode.
  ;; rather that just 1 second by default
  ;; because probably I need some more time on each break.
  (setq edebug-sit-for-seconds 2)

  ;; enable sexp evaluation.
  (put 'eval-expression 'disable nil)
